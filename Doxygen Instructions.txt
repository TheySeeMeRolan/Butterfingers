Rules:
  1) Comments can come before the code item.
  2) For class members and parameters they may also come after them.
  3)  They may be either brief (one line) or detailed or both.
  4)  Put the reference documentation type comments (class and method descriptions) in the .h file and not in (or, at least, in addition to) the .cxx files.
